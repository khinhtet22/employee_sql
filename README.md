# Employee Analytics Project
Overview
This project analyzes employee data to uncover insights on workforce demographics, salary trends, department transfers, and gender pay gaps. The data was sourced from a publicly available dataset hosted on GitHub.

SQL queries were developed to extract key metrics and relationships, and these were visualized using Power BI to create interactive dashboards.

Data Source
The dataset was obtained from GitHub:
[https://github.com/<username>/<repository>]
(replace this with the actual GitHub repo URL)

It includes tables such as:

employees (employee details)

salaries (salary history)

departments (department info)

dept_emp (employee department assignments)

dept_manager (department managers)

titles (employee job titles)

The dataset is a snapshot modeled after a real-world company database.

How to Run

Notes
The dataset uses to_date = '9999-01-01' to mark active records.

Queries assume a MySQL-compatible environment (adjust for your SQL engine if needed).

Window functions such as RANK() and LEAD() are used for ranking and transfer analysis.
