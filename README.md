# Employee Analytics Project

## Overview

This project analyzes employee data to uncover insights on workforce demographics, salary trends, department transfers, and gender pay gaps. The dataset is sourced from a publicly available dataset hosted on GitHub and adapted from a sample employee database originally created by Fusheng Wang and Carlo Zaniolo.

SQL queries were developed to extract key metrics and relationships. Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards for data visualization.

- ✅ **Gender Contributions** – Gender distribution across departments  
- ✅ **Top 10 Highest Salaries** – Current highest-paid employees  
- ✅ **Top 3 Salaries per Department** – Salary rankings within departments  
- ✅ **Salary Growth Trends** – Employees with notable salary increases  
- ✅ **Gender Pay Gap** – Average salaries by gender and role  
- ✅ **Post-1980 Entry Salaries** – Highest entry salaries by job/department

## Visualizing in Power BI

1. Connect Power BI Desktop to your SQL server/database.
2. Import SQL query results into Power BI.
3. Create visuals using:
   - Column/bar charts
   - Slicers for gender, department, year
   - KPI cards for salary averages and counts
4. Customize dashboards for HR reporting.
5. Optionally, schedule automatic data refresh.
